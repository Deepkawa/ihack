If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.
