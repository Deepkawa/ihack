I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

Imaginations are boundless and opportunities are infinite. Everything is going to be connected SCOPE of IoT? What is IoT? Internet of Things can connect devices embedded in various systems to the internet. When devices/objects can represent themselves digitally, they can be controlled from anywhere. The connectivity then helps us capture more data from more places, ensuring more ways of increasing efficiency and improving safety and IoT security. IoT in a nutshell is about connecting all devices -phones, watches, cooker, stove, TVs, etc -to the internet so that it can send and receive data to make smart predictions. The sensors in these devices enable the transfer of data. IoT has applications across sectors ranging from agriculture and healthcare to education. IoT is a transformational force that can help companies improve performance and deliver better results. Businesses in the utilities, oil & gas, insurance, manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and retail sectors can reap the benefits of IoT by making more informed decisions, aided by the torrent of interactional and transactional data at their disposal. The international research firm Gartner estimates that by the end of “Smart things are starting to power a fourth Industrial Revolution (after steam, electricity and wired computers).” 2016, there were 3.8 billion connected things out there—smart cars, smoke detectors, door locks, industrial robots, streetlights, heart monitors, trains, wind turbines, even tennis racquets and toasters. By 2020, Gartner estimates there will be 25 billion of these smart devices, transmitting tiny amounts of data to us, to the cloud and to each other. IoT & JOBS New technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to create 10-15 million jobs even as the IT services sector is struggling to create new jobs in the economy, said telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan. “In Bengaluru and other places, there have been concerns about how Indian IT will cope with new challenges and new technologies. We believe, or rather it is estimated, that India can have 10-15 million new jobs created in IoT alone,“ Sundararajan said at a news conference at the IoT India Congress 2017. “IoT has huge potential for job creation and most of these will not be created by large companies but by startups,“ Sundararajan said. “Startups have created solutions in diagnostics, sport wearables, water management -the areas which were traditionally problematic have become opportunities.“ ABOUT TELEMAN Teleman Institute is engaged in offering career oriented courses relevant to the Industry demand and in keeping with the current times, in wireless telecom, wireline telecom, data networks in telecom, passive infra in telecom, unified communication, smart world communication and mobile application development.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

 Norms","Dear All, The Government of India announced several important changes to the FDI policy with the objective of further liberalising and simplifying the foreign direct investment regime.

Dear All, The Government of India announced several important changes to the FDI policy with the objective of further liberalising and simplifying the foreign direct investment regime. The key changes made are briefly summarised in the attached alert. We hope you will find this useful. Regards, The Dhruva Team","Regulatory Alert 11 January 2018 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy liberalized in key sectors The Cabinet approved several important changes to the FDI policy with the objective of further liberalising and simplifying the foreign direct investment regime. The key changes made are briefly summarised below: Single Brand Retail Trading Foreign Investment in Single Brand retail was permitted under the automatic route upto 49%. Investments beyond 49% required Government approval. Going forward, 100% FDI under the automatic route will be permitted for Single Brand retail. The requirement of sourcing 30% of purchases from India has also been modified. Going forward, it has been decided to permit single brand retail trading entity to set off its incremental sourcing of goods from India for global operations during initial 5 years, beginning 1st April of the year of the opening of first store against the mandatory sourcing requirement of 30% of purchases from India. For this purpose, incremental sourcing will mean the increase in terms of value of such global sourcing from India for that single brand (in rupee terms) in a particular financial year over the preceding financial year, by the non-resident entities undertaking single brand retail trading entity, either directly or through their group companies. After completion of this period, the entity shall be required to meet the 30% sourcing norms directly towards its India’s operations on an annual basis. Construction Development: Townships, Housing, Built-up Infrastructure and Real Estate Broking Services Real-estate broking services have been excluded from the scope of ‘real estate’ business. Hence, the will be eligible for 100% FDI under automatic route Power Exchanges Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) / Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were allowed to invest in Power Exchanges only by purchases in the secondary market. This restriction has been removed, and FIIs/FPIs will be able to invest in Power Exchanges through the primary market as well. © 2018 Copyright Dhruva Advisors LLP. 1 Other key changes Other key changes in the FDI policy include: a) Opening of the automatic route for issue of shares for non-cash consideration (such as pre-incorporation expenses, import of machinery etc.) b) Foreign investment into an Indian company, engaged only in the activity of investing in the capital of other Indian company/ies/ LLP and in Core Investing Companies is presently allowed upto 100% with prior Government approval. It has now been decided to align FDI policy on these sectors with FDI policy provisions on Other Financial Services. Going forward, if the above activities are regulated by any financial sector regulator, then foreign investment upto 100% under automatic route shall be allowed. On the other hand, if they are not regulated by any financial sector regulator or where only part is regulated or where there is doubt regarding the regulatory oversight, foreign investment up to 100% will be allowed under Government approval route, subject to conditions including minimum capitalization requirement, as may be decided by the Government. c) It is provided that where a foreign investor specifies a particular auditor / audit firm having an international network for the Indian investee company, a joint audit of such company must be carried out where one of the auditors is not part of the same network. © 2018 Copyright Dhruva Advisors LLP. 2 www.dhruvaadvisors.com Follo w us on: ADDRESS KEY CONTACTS Mumbai Dinesh Kanabar (Mumbai) 1101, One India Bulls Centre, 11th Floor, Tower 2B, 841, Senapati Bapat Marg, Elphinstone Road (West), Mumbai 400 013 Tel:+91 22 6108 1000 / 1900 dinesh.kanabar@dhruvaadvisors.com Vishal Gada (Ahmedabad) vishal.gada@dhruvaadvisors.com Ajay Rotti (Bengaluru) Ahmedabad ajay.rotti@dhruvaadvisors.com B3, 3rd Floor, Safal Profitaire, Near Auda Garden, Prahladnagar, Corporate Road, Ahmedabad - 380 015 Tel: +91-79-6134 3434 Krishan Malhotra (Delhi / NCR) krishan.malhotra@dhruvaadvisors.com Lawrence Zlatkin (New York) Bengaluru lawrence.zlatkin@dhruvaadvisors.com Prestige Terraces, 2nd Floor Union Street, Infantry Road, Bengaluru 560 001 Tel: +91-80-4660 2500 Mahip Gupta (Singapore) Delhi / NCR Pratik Shah (Dubai) 101 & 102, 1st Floor, Tower 4B DLF Corporate Park M G Road, Gurgaon Haryana - 122 002 Tel: +91-124-668 7000 pratik.shah@dhruvaadvisors.com mahip.gupta@dhruvaadvisors.com Dhruva Advisors was named “India Tax Firm of the Year 2017” at International Tax Review’s Asia Tax Awards 2017 New York 340 Madison Avenue, 19th Floor, New York, New York 10173 USA Tel: +1-212-220-9494 Singapore Dhruva Advisors (Singapore) Pte.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder. NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios. As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (eIA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). We are now introducing additional feature of Portfolio Value Trend whereby you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new fields viz., ""Date of Birth"" and ""Aadhaar Number"" under the section of ""Know more about your accounts"" in respect of your NSDL demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of ""Annualised Return"" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios.

0,hdfcsec-research@hdfcsec.com,Resend - Media and Telecom: 3QFY18E Results Preview,"Dear Murthy, Media and Telecom: 3QFY18E Results Preview Media Zee Entertainment: Zee is well-poised for strong operating performance in the near term led by twin benefits of viewership gains and recovery in ad spends partly led by low base. Subscription revenue growth is expected to be modest led by digitisation. However increasing viewership on digital platforms and likely increase of competitive intensity in core regional markets poses risk to advertising revenues. Consolidation amongst DTH operators, lack of sports properties and weak balance sheet of MSOs can impact subscription revenue growth. Zees well-entrenched national footprint limits scope for expansion led growth. Zee has registered healthy growth in last 4-5 years as digitisation enabled launch of new channels and improved subscription revenues. However changing industry dynamics demanding increased investments on digital content and as the base-effect starts catching-up, delivering healthy double-digit growth could become challenging. We roll-forward to Dec-19 with TP of Rs 618 (Rs 575 earlier). Post 20% run-up in last three month from lows of Rs 480 and impending business risks, we downgrade Zee to Neutral from BUY. Dish TV Videocon: Dish would report its financials including Videocon D2H. We estimate financials of merged entity for 3QFY18 including historical for like-to-like comparison. We highlight that actual may vary materially in event of any changes to accounting policies of the two companies. Our positive view on Dish TV despite weak performance in recent past is derived from its inexpensive valuations (9.8/8.6x FY19/20E EV/E for merged operations without synergy) and synergies from the merger with VD2H (key focus area) and digitisation. Top pick: Dish TV Telecom 3QFY18 outlook: 3QFY18 is likely to be another weak quarter for Bharti and Idea. IUC rate cut by 57% (14p/min to 6p/min) effective 1 st Oct, 17 to impact Bharti and Ideas India wireless EBITDA leading to drop of 10% and 22% QoQ respectively. Accelerated ARPU downgrade (ex-IUC) on account of increasing proportion of bundled plans to further exert pressure. However, with sectors transformation into three player market, our medium term outlook is positive. Bharti Infratel too is likely to report subdued performance lead by tenancy exit of Rcom and Aircel. Jio is the primary source of growth for the tower industry.

IUC rate cut by 57% (14p/min to 6p/min) effective 1st Oct, 17 to impact Bharti and Idea’s India wireless EBITDA leading to drop of 10% and 22% QoQ respectively. Accelerated ARPU downgrade (ex-IUC) on account of increasing proportion of bundled plans to further exert pressure.  However, with sectors transformation into three player market, our medium term outlook is positive.  Bharti Infratel too is likely to report subdued performance lead by tenancy exit of Rcom and Aircel. Jio is the primary source of growth for the tower industry. 5 TELECOM: 3QFY18E RESULTS PREVIEW 3QFY18E: Mixed bag COMPANY 3QFY18E OUTLOOK WHAT’S LIKELY  Outlook on capex and ARPU trajectory WEAK  We expect the India wireless business revenue to decline 9.6% QoQ and EBITDA 10.3% owing to IUC rate cuts and pressure on postpaid revenues due to widening gap in prepaid vs. postpaid pricing  Expect the improved trajectory of Africa to maintain momentum  Sharp 12% QoQ decline in revenue owing to IUC rate cut and bundled plan offering to result in steep 22% QoQ decline in EBITDA  Outlook on capex and ARPU trajectory  In our opinion, ARPU should bottom out in 4QFY18 or 1QFY19.

0,idbibank@idbibank.com,Updation of your latest KYC details with the bank,"Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for your patronage. We appreciate your valuable relationship and business opportunity with IDBI Bank. As you are aware, in terms of provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002(PMLA) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, Bank had taken up the exercise relating to Customer Identification Data updation for KYC compliance. Further, the bank had sent First notice during June, 2017, requesting to submit the latest KYC documents to your home/ nearest branch immediately. The second and final notice was also sent during October, 2017, requesting to submit the latest KYC documents to your home/ nearest branch immediately.However, from our records, it is observed that you are yet to submit the required KYC documents as mandated. In this regard, we may bring to your kind notice that Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its Master Circular No. RBI/2015-16/42 DBR.AML.BC.No.15/ 14.01.001 /2015-16 dated July 1, 2015 and in its Master direction Circular No. RBI/ DBR/ 2015-16 / 18 DBR.AML.BC.No.81/14.01.001/2015-16 dated February 25, 2016, advised that: As regards non-compliance of KYC requirements by the customers despite repeated reminders by the banks, it has been decided that banks should impose 'partial freezing' on such KYC non-compliant in a phased manner. Meanwhile, the account holders can revive accounts by submitting the KYC documents as per instructions in force. While imposing 'partial freezing', banks are advised to ensure that the option of 'partial freezing' is exercised after giving due notice of three months initially to the customers to comply with KYC requirement and followed by a reminder for further of three months. Thereafter, banks may impose 'partial freezing' by allowing all credits and disallowing all debits with the freedom to close the accounts. If the accounts are still KYC non-compliant after six months of imposing initial 'partial freezing' banks may disallow all debits and credits from/to the accounts, rendering them inoperative. Further, it would always open to the bank to close the account of such customers. In view of the above guidelines, we once again request your kind self to submit the mandated KYC documents immediately to your home/ nearest branch not later than January 11, 2018 failing which the Bank will be constrained to apply partial freeze by allowing all credits and disallowing all debits with the option to close the accounts by the bank without further reminders to your accounts and subsequent steps as may be instructed by RBI. Further, Bank shall not be responsible for dishonor of any cheques / standing instructions/ ECS etc presented in the account. Please therefore co-operate.

All your investments in equity shares, preference shares, mutual funds, bonds, debentures, securitised instruments, government securities (other than held in SGL), commercial paper and certificates of deposit are included in this Consolidated Account Statement. It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder. NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios. As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (eIA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). We are now introducing additional feature of Portfolio Value Trend whereby you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new fields viz., ""Date of Birth"" and ""Aadhaar Number"" under the section of ""Know more about your accounts"" in respect of your NSDL demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of ""Annualised Return"" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios. I am sure that you will find NSDL CAS very useful. It offers you unparalleled convenience in keeping track of your investment portfolio.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

The GES was the largest entrepreneurial conference attended by over 1200 entrepreneurs from across the world that was jointly organised by NITI Aayog and the Government of the United States of America. The Summit was inaugurated by Honble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi in the presence of Ms. Ivanka Trump, Advisor to President Trump who was leading the US delegation. On the sidelines of the GES 2017, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) jointly with NITI Aayog organized seven Road to GES events in Chennai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Bhubaneshwar, Chandigarh and Hyderabad which brought together over 1500 entrepreneurs and key stakeholders from the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. Over 50 percent participation in each of these programs was from women entrepreneurs. To keep the momentum on by strengthening the ecosystem that nurtures and fosters entrepreneurship, FICCI is partnering with leading institutions and universities in the US to design a one week programme especially for women entrepreneurs from India. As a part of this delegation, FICCI will be organising immersion boot camps, B2B Meetings, visit to iconic companies and interaction with US investors. The visit will culminate with a cultural evening. We invite women entrepreneurs & executives from across the country from diverse sectors including but not limited to pharmaceuticals, healthcare, biotechnology, energy, media, financial technologies, information technology, cyber security, water, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, robotics, e-commerce, etc. to join the delegation. To defray a part of the expenses incurred in connection with organizing the visit, a delegation fee of INR 50,000/- ( + GST @ 18%) is being charged per delegate.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant. Level /Title Non-CPA Salary CPA Salary Salary Differential Year 1 $68,000 $68,000 0 Year 2 (1-3 Year Associate) $82,000 $90,200 $8,200 Year 4 (Senior Auditor) $101,250 $111,375 $10,125 Year 11 (Manager) $124,525 $133,500 $8,975 Year 20 (Senior Manager) $162,477 $191,750 $29,723 Year 40 $293,451 $346,322 $52,871 Lifetime Earnings (Pre-tax) $6,934,600 $7,959,470 $52,871 CPA Incremental Lifetime Earnings $1,024,870 Source:Internet Scholarships available up to INR 33,000 for CAs enrolling for CPA Certification before 31st January 2018 .

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

0,research@email.religareonline.com,Commodity Yearly Outlook 2018,"Year 2017 proved to be yet another exciting year for financial market participants. Global equities outperformed all other segments and gave above average returns. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up by 25%, while the S&P 500 surged by 20%.On the domestic front, CNX Nifty returned 28%. In fixed income group, yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell by 0.49%, while bond prices moved up. In the commodity segment, base metals were the next choice of investors after equities, which on an average returned more than 20% with aluminum and copper leading the rally. Bullion and energy underperformed. Agri segment, on the other hand, was an outperformer. Major tradable commodities gave more than 20% return with mentha oil leading the sector with 74% return. Another surprising development was the erosion in the value of US dollar despite of three rate hikes during the year. On the other hand, Crypto-currency, a new digital currency, emerged as a new investment avenue with Bitcoin giving a whopping 1200% return. The ride in 2017 was not as smooth for bullion where prices see-sawed considerably. Gold witnessed a peak price of $1357.5/ounce (Rs.30474/10gms) for the year and gained nearly 13 percent in international market at the end of the year. Meanwhile, silver remained laggard comparatively after marking a peak at $18.65/ounce (Rs.41927/kg) and settled with the runner up position. While weak dollar, low inflation and geo-political concerns were favoring precious metals, rising interest rates in the US, weak physical demand in India, low ETF demand capped the upside. For the year 2018, gold should attract attention in the first half following seasonal demand and act as a hedge against falling greenback. While clouds of geopolitical concerns will remain at the helm, inflation is still a concern and will turn Fed to be cautious and follow a gradual rate hike path in the coming year. Amongst the metals, aluminum led the rally giving whopping return of more than 25% on account of improved Chinese demand, followed by copper which returned over 23% for the year. Zinc came third in list with a commendable return of 22% amidst rise in demand from the steel industry. Amongst other base metals, lead and nickel also followed suit, returning nearly 17% and 20% for the year respectively. The rally was supported on reduced production by mines as China restrains smelters in order to control pollution. For 2018, the top pick would be copper that has been a frontrunner in the metals complex. Though first quarter may witness profit booking, but thereafter, good price action can be seen on the back of strong fundamentals and positive trend that has developed on price chart. While base metals dominated in 2017, energy segment thwarted investors expectations by giving only a marginal return in oil. Though crude prices have recovered more than 40% since hitting their lows in June 2017, but still on a yearly basis, crude oil gave marginal returns of more than 5% on domestic bourses. Natural gas plunged more than 24% for the year on weaker demand due to warmer weather conditions and massive surge in drilling. Though, energy segment was a laggard, oil seems to get a boost as global supply and demand for crude oil will be largely balanced next year, as growth in consumption helps erode a three-year old supply overhang and should mostly offset a steep rise in output. While fundamentals are taking shape, chart structure suggests an up surge after base formation in 2017 and makes oil an attractive investment opportunity. In agriculture segment, 2017 was a remarkable year with substantial gains. Consumption-led recovery in India and other emerging economies will be seen as a booster for global demand and for the domestic Agro industry. Going forward, cotton appears to be a decent bullish bet amid prospects of higher consumption. But by and large, trading opportunity seems much better for Guar seed and guar gum this year due to increased export demand, lower production estimates and lower inventory. Overall, performance of commodities was backed by upswing in global economy, improving fundamentals, weak dollar and geo-political concerns. For the year ahead, the US tax reforms, monetary policies of the major central banks; demand-supply balance would be the major look out areas to decipher the trend for commodities. To recap the year gone by and explore the opportunities in 2018, we hereby roll our Commodity Yearly Outlook 2018 .

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

Vikram Thermo is a niche player which is into the manufacture of methacrylic acid copolymer-based range of products used in the pharmaceutical industry to address specific drug delivery requirements. These polymers are essentially meant to control the release of API in solid dosage form so as to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. In addition the company also manufactures Diphenyl Oxide (Diphenyl Ether) which is used as a perfumery stabiliser and for manufacturing heat transfer fluid. The company is one of the pioneers in the manufacture of Diphenyl Oxide and there are only a few players in the space. The key takeaways from the meeting are as follows: 1. The company achieved revenues of Rs500mn in FY17, out of which 75% comes from sales of Methacyrlic Acid Copolymer, while Diphenyl Oxide contributes the rest. Revenues from Diphenyl Oxide have been stable for years, while revenues from the sale of drug-coating polymers have been growing. Currently, the company is operating at almost 100% of its capacity. 2. In the drug coating category, the company has its products available in four different formats - organic solution, powder, granules and ready coat. The various pharmaceutical applications of these products include: a) Sustained release NOT RATED Sector: Pharmaceutical CMP: Rs133 Vishal Manchanda Research Analyst vishal.manchanda@nirmalbang.com +91 97374 37148 Key Data Current Shares O/S (mn) Mkt Cap (Rsbn/US$mn) 0.7/11.7 52 Wk H / L (Rs) 152/101 Daily Vol. (3M NSE Avg.) 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 c) Moisture protection 60 Jan-17 70 Mar-17 4. From a market share perspective, Vikram Thermo (India) believes it can achieve high single-digit market share in India. The leading player in this business is a Germany-based company - Evonik - which is a global leader. Vikram Thermo (India) believes its product quality is at par with global peers, but it needs to work on the perception. It has made efforts to ramp up sales and marketing expenditure so as to expand business volume and client base. Currently its client base in India comprises mainly small to mid-sized pharmaceutical companies. 5. In terms of expansion plan, the company prefers to go slow and prefers not to leverage beyond a point. The next project that it envisages is putting up a manufacturing facility for making carbomers used in gels and diapers. 3 May-17 Jul-17 Sep-17 VIKRAM THERMO d) Taste masking 3. In drug coating segment, exports have been negligible to the tune of Rs35mn in FY17. However, the company is looking to expand this segment of its business. It has recently invested in additional capacities which are CGMP-compliant with an objective to build the export business. With the expansion in place, the manufacturing capacity now stands doubled. The company has received EXCIPACT and HALAL certifications for its manufacturing facilities. In addition the company also has made a DMF (drug master filing) for its product so as to tap business opportunities in the US as and when they arise. 11,249 One -Year Indexed Stock Performance b)

Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

0,hdfcsec-research@hdfcsec.com,Oil & Gas: 3QFY18E Results Preview,"Dear Murthy, Oil & Gas: 3QFY18E Results Preview Crude prices: Brent has jumped 22% QoQ and 20% YoY to USD 61.5/bbl in 3QFY18 owing to continuation of supply cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries (excluding the US). We expect inventory gains to downstream companies. GRM: Singapore complex GRM was USD 7.3/bbl (-12% QoQ, +9.3% YoY) in 3QFY18. Strong margins in Gasoil and Naphtha have partially negated the weakness in Gasoline and LPG margins. Downstream: Oil refineries to benefit from crude inventory gains, which will be offset by lower refining and marketing margins. Reduction in marketing margins (~10% QoQ) largely attributed to the lack of adequate increase in auto fuel prices during the state elections. OMCs overall volumes are likely to grow by 8% QoQ. Upstream players: OPEC and its allies outside OPEC has agreed to maintain oil production cut till Dec-18. We expect oil price to remain strong following robust compliance to production cut from OPEC and non-OPEC members. We are changing oil price assumption for FY18/19/20 from USD 55/bbl to USD 57.5/65/65/bbl. Thus, ONGCs FY18E EPS increase by 17% to Rs 17.1 and FY19E and FY20E EPS increase by 39% and 36% to Rs 22.1 and Rs 23.2. OILs FY18E EPS increase by 8% to Rs 32.4 and FY19E and FY20E EPS increase by 29% and 28% to Rs 41.2 and Rs 43.6. We are upgrading ONGC and Oil India to BUY. RIL: Standalone PAT to decline 2.3% QoQ on back of reduction in GRM to USD 11.5/bbl vs 12 in 2Q. Sequentially, petchem EBITDA is likely to be flattish. Higher petchem volumes will offset lower polymer margins. Gas players IGL: 14.6% YoY volume growth led by 16.5% volume growth from PNG segment.

Oza, Contact: +91 223045 3600, Email: complianceofficer@hdfcsec.com Dear Murthy, Oil & Gas: 3QFY18E Results Preview Crude prices: Brent has jumped 22% QoQ and 20% YoY to USD 61.5/bbl in 3QFY18 owing to continuation of supply cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries (excluding the US). We expect inventory gains to downstream companies. GRM: Singapore complex GRM was USD 7.3/bbl (-12% QoQ, +9.3% YoY) in 3QFY18. Strong margins in Gasoil and Naphtha have partially negated the weakness in Gasoline and LPG margins. Downstream: Oil refineries to benefit from crude inventory gains, which will be offset by lower refining and marketing margins. Reduction in marketing margins (~10% QoQ) largely attributed to the lack of adequate increase in auto fuel prices during the state elections. OMCs overall volumes are likely to grow by 8% QoQ. Upstream players: OPEC and its allies outside OPEC has agreed to maintain oil production cut till Dec-18. We expect oil price to remain strong following robust compliance to production cut from OPEC and non-OPEC members. We are changing oil price assumption for FY18/19/20 from USD 55/bbl to USD 57.5/65/65/bbl. Thus, ONGCs FY18E EPS increase by 17% to Rs 17.1 and FY19E and FY20E EPS increase by 39% and 36% to Rs 22.1 and Rs 23.2. OILs FY18E EPS increase by 8% to Rs 32.4 and FY19E and FY20E EPS increase by 29% and 28% to Rs 41.2 and Rs 43.6. We are upgrading ONGC and Oil India to BUY. RIL: Standalone PAT to decline 2.3% QoQ on back of reduction in GRM to USD 11.5/bbl vs 12 in 2Q. Sequentially, petchem EBITDA is likely to be flattish.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

0,info@thetrainingprofs.com,=?UTF-8?B?4puU77iPIENBIEFsZXJ0cyE=?=,"Hi there, How are you doing today? I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation.

Hi there, How are you doing today? I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine. I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year.* *If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the *Certified Public Accountant (CPA) *Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. *Become a CPA in less than 1 year*: You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. *Global recognition:* If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. *Increased Demand for CPAs in India: *CPA is the* *US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check *Payscale *. Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant. *Level /Title* *Non-CPA Salary* *CPA Salary* *Salary Differential* Year 1 $68,000 $68,000 0 Year 2 (1-3 Year Associate) $82,000 $90,200 $8,200 Year 4 (Senior Auditor) $101,250 $111,375 $10,125 Year 11 (Manager) $124,525 $133,500 $8,975 Year 20 (Senior Manager) $162,477 $191,750 $29,723 Year 40 $293,451 $346,322 $52,871 Lifetime Earnings (Pre-tax) *$6,934,600* *$7,959,470* *$52,871* CPA Incremental Lifetime Earnings $1,024,870 Source:Internet Scholarships available up to INR 33,000 for CAs enrolling for CPA Certification before 31st January 2018.

The Mutual Fund Industry at large has witnessed a phenomenal growth last year, particularly the SIP registrations. We are glad to be a part of this growth. Currently, we contribute to 5.15% of lump sum transactions and 2.12% of SIP transactions as compared to industry volumes. We are glad that with your continued support and patronage we have achieved new milestones in 2017, wherein we have processed more than 50 lakh transactions in the current financial year (FY17-18) aggregating to value of Rs. 24,713 crores. We processed more than one lakh transactions in a day, which further increased to processing of more than 1.35 lakh transactions in a day. Period 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 (Apr-Dec 17) No of transactions (in lakhs) 7.69 26.76 50.21 Volume (INR in crore) 7,624 16,563 24,713 No of SIPs 61,104 2,33,255 5,23,084 We strongly believe in creating value for our members and hence have designed our platform to be a combination of Best features and Best practices. Delivering seamless transaction capabilities in a most compliant manner is our key mantra. Our platform is much more than just a transaction routing engine. Its a complete Mutual Fund solution. To further aggrandize our offering in 2018, and pursuing the Digital India concept, we plan to introduce below mentioned features on our Mutual Fund platform: Mobile application for iOS Additional features in Android mobile application Mail back data upload facility for Franklin and Sundaram Top up SIP facility SIP with Insurance Facility for investors to initiate SIP from their login in case Mandate is already registered Pre & post sales tools, attribution MIS for AMC & distributors Aadhar updation Recently, we introduced the E-mandate functionality for individual and Anyone or Survivor / Either or survivor mode. We are one of the first platforms to introduce this, it is a very significant step towards digitisation, which empowers our members to initiate an SIP for their investor without any paper work and at a lightning speed. NSE was a pioneer to introduce a host of digital features like FATCA registration, Digital Client On-boarding, Online NRI transactions, Aadhar based e-KYC, on its Mutual Fund platform. The rationale to launch this platform was to eliminate paper based transactions and to design an offering with minimal or low infrastructure cost for our members. All our stakeholders i.e. Members, AMCs and RTAs have been very co-operative in this endeavour and we are looking forward to implement a similar digitisation drive in Non financial transactions also, once the complete digitisation in financial transactions is complete. As the New Year dawns, new expectations and hopes arise. We would like to start off 2018 with expectation of you going completely digital and using our platform to route all your transactions. We hope that this mutually warm relationship between us will continue to flourish. Kindly accept our best wishes for all your endeavors.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant. Level /Title Non-CPA Salary CPA Salary Salary Differential Year 1 $68,000 $68,000 0 Year 2 (1-3 Year Associate) $82,000 $90,200 $8,200 Year 4 (Senior Auditor) $101,250 $111,375 $10,125 Year 11 (Manager) $124,525 $133,500 $8,975 Year 20 (Senior Manager) $162,477 $191,750 $29,723 Year 40 $293,451 $346,322 $52,871 Lifetime Earnings (Pre-tax) $6,934,600 $7,959,470 $52,871 CPA Incremental Lifetime Earnings $1,024,870 Source:Internet Scholarships available up to INR 33,000 for CAs enrolling for CPA Certification before 31st January 2018 .

Here are 3 Reasons why the *Certified Public Accountant (CPA) *Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. *Become a CPA in less than 1 year*: You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. *Global recognition:* If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. *Increased Demand for CPAs in India: *CPA is the* *US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check *Payscale *. Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant. *Level /Title* *Non-CPA Salary* *CPA Salary* *Salary Differential* Year 1 $68,000 $68,000 0 Year 2 (1-3 Year Associate) $82,000 $90,200 $8,200 Year 4 (Senior Auditor) $101,250 $111,375 $10,125 Year 11 (Manager) $124,525 $133,500 $8,975 Year 20 (Senior Manager) $162,477 $191,750 $29,723 Year 40 $293,451 $346,322 $52,871 Lifetime Earnings (Pre-tax) *$6,934,600* *$7,959,470* *$52,871* CPA Incremental Lifetime Earnings $1,024,870 Source:Internet Scholarships available up to INR 33,000 for CAs enrolling for CPA Certification before 31st January 2018.

Some of the key amendments are as follows: Single-Brand Retail Trading 100% FDI in single-brand retail trading ( SBRT ) via the automatic route is now permitted. Sourcing requirements have been liberalised as follows: after the SBRT entity opens its first store in India, it has the option to set-off its incremental sourcing of goods from India for global operations, against the mandatory requirement to source 30% of purchases from India. This option is available for the initial 5 years of the SBRT entity; incremental sourcing means the increase in value of global sourcing from India for that single brand (in INR terms) in a particular financial year over the preceding financial year, by the non-resident entities undertaking SBRT, either directly or through their group companies; and after completion of this 5 year period, the Indian operations of the SBRT entity shall be required to meet the 30% sourcing norms on an annual basis. Further, non-resident entities may carry out SBRT, either by themselves or through an Indian entity.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

We think that the merger, if implemented, would create combined entity that would benefit vastly from the significant complementarity of the client bases of the two amalgamating entities. The combined entity would tap into the large retail client base of CFL (5 mn) to push, potentially, the entire gamut of retail loan products, while simultaneously leveraging bank access to low-cost deposits franchise, something that could now be ramped up by selling liability products as well to CFL client base, particularly CASA. Transfer of technology and analytics expertise from CFL to combined entity also augurs particularly well from a retail lending perspective Results To be Announced (PAT Rs in Cr) 16-Jan Dec'16 Sept'17 Exp NBIE Agro Tech Foods Ltd. 8.3 8.6 9.5 - Den Networks Ltd.

We think that the merger, if implemented, would create combined entity that would benefit vastly from the significant complementarity of the client bases of the two amalgamating entities. The combined entity would tap into the large retail client base of CFL (5 mn) to push, potentially, the entire gamut of retail loan products, while simultaneously leveraging bank access to low-cost deposits franchise, something that could now be ramped up by selling liability products as well to CFL client base, particularly CASA. Transfer of technology and analytics expertise from CFL to combined entity also augurs particularly well from a retail lending perspective Results To be Announced (PAT Rs in Cr) 16-Jan Dec'16 Sept'17 Exp NBIE Agro Tech Foods Ltd. 8.3 8.6 9.5 - Den Networks Ltd.

 India across Urban Local Bodies and Commercial & Residential Setups -
 InfraInsights Research Report","Evaluating Multi-billion Opportunity in Solid Waste Management in India across Urban Local Bodies and Commercial & Residential Setups Overview of Report India is well on its course to achieve its objective of electricity for all, and one can expect the goal to be achieved by 2019 or by 2020. After electricity, water is most important utility service which will need tremendous attention of the government, India is blessed with several rivers but thats under threat due to climate change and India is already declared as water stressed country. After water, waste management will become the most important area for the government, as currently almost all cities are facing enormous challenge in effectively dealing with solid waste management. With growing population and rapid urbanization, waste generation in India has increased significantly over the last decade. More than 70% of collected urban waste is dumped at landfills. And most of them are brimming. It has also been estimated that annual waste generation will likely increase to 165 million tonnes by 2030. This means that 66,000 hectares of land will be required to set up a landfill site that is 10 meters high and can hold 20 years worth of waste. To put things in perspective, that is almost 90% of Bengalurus area. If the current waste management scenario does not improve, one can soon expect to be buried in our own muck. Almost all the Municipalities are struggling to effectively manage waste generated across different cities. MCGM, is staring at brimming landfills, fire related issues in landfills, lack of processing capacities and as a result has resorted to force citizen participation in solid waste management. MCGM, has decided not to pick solid waste for societies / complexes, of more than 20,000 square meters or those producing more than 100kg wet waste per day. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)has issued notices to 23,161 housing societies for not following the mandatory rule, leaving citizens in lurch for no mistake of theirs. Had BMC implemented the SWM Rules 2000, by now it would have had effective and efficient solid waste management capabilities in place. Data represented in the chart below indicates how garbage is overflowing in almost all landfills across the country. According to data gathered by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), municipal authorities in India had established only 13 waste-to-energy plants, 56 bio-methanation plants, 22 refuse-derived fuel plants and 553 compost and vermicompost plants until 2014. However, more treatment and processing plants need to be built to realize the true potential of solid waste. According to the Planning Commission, municipal solid waste that is not utilized has the potential to produce 439 MW of power from 32,890 tons per day of combustible waste. This includes refuse-derived fuel, 1.3 million cubic meters of biogas per day and 5.4 million metric tonnes of compost (all annual) that can be utilized for agricultural purposes. InfraInsights sees waste management as a multi-billion dollar opportunity for private sector as the public sector finds itself in spot when it comes to effective waste management. ULBs will seek participation of private sector and its citizens to help deal with the challenge of burgeoning solid waste in almost all cities across the country. Its inevitable that decentralized approach to waste management will lead to capacity creation at community level as well as centralized level in ULBs. Sanitary landfills is no more a viable option for mega cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai & others, and hence technology will have to leveraged to effectively and efficiently, reduce, recycle, re-use waste. Demand for semi-automatic or fully automatic composting machine is likely to increase in the residential societies and demand for WTE, Biomethanization, RDF setups are slated to increase across ULBs. Private sector, whether directly or indirectly will play a very important role in partnering with ULBs, Municipalities to shoulder the burden of waste management through technology. InfraInsights research report Evaluating Multi-billion Opportunity in Solid Waste Management in India across Urban Local Bodies and Commercial & Residential Setups, aims to quantify the business opportunity that waste management as a segment will generate for private sector and companies in the area of public utility services business are expected to immensely benefit out of this demand. Technology providers will see demand from ULBs and Residential societies alike. The report will do a detailed profiling of all the major ULBs in countries to understand its capabilities, gap areas, cost efficiency / inefficiency, budgets, technology deployed, forthcoming project for capacity creation and O&M, to help companies in private sector, draw out its growth strategy in this very critical segment of waste management. Report will be primary research driven, and the analysis and insights will be presented in a manner that it can be leveraged by companies for its business planning in the area of solid waste management.

Key benefits of investing in Equities as an asset class:  Participation in entrepreneurship  Wealth Creation in long term  Dividend income  Liquidity in times of exigencies  Tax benefits on capital appreciation and income  Corporate control in form of voting rights Why Equities? In a nutshell  Equity markets have historically produced higher returns than gold, real-estate, bank deposits or other fixed income assets over the longer term (source: Bloomberg)  Historical data states that the risk of capital loss does exist especially in the shorter term but with longer periods of investments, this risk is negated  As markets are not always efficient, using an active manager may also help to manage risks and improve performance  A good manager can identify high growth potential securities to invest in by carrying out their own research on sectors and companies, including face-to-face meetings with management to determine the intrinsic value of a company’s share price Why Equities? Because key objective of investing in equities is to create wealth.

Why Equities? Food for thought !!!  Over long periods of time equities do deliver in line with corporate earnings; but it’s a known fact that the volatility in share prices is way higher than volatility of earnings themselves  This volatility in share prices results in emotional response of greed in rising markets and fear in falling markets. Mostly these responses are way more exaggerated on upside as well as downside  When evaluated in hindsight after the data plays out; one usually rues that responses were disproportionate to changes in corporate earnings Why Large-caps? Key Traits of Large cap companies:  Well established track records of Management  Sound financials and balance sheets  Demonstrated ability to pay dividends  Relatively stable companies as compared to midcaps  Stocks are seldom mispriced by the markets  Wide research coverage  Often held by large institutional investors (FIIs and DIIs) Why Large-caps?

Why Motilal Oswal PMS?  Motilal Oswal Group possess legacy in equities for over 3 decade  Motilal Oswal AMC is chaired by Mr. Raamdeo Agrawal, one of the most honored and trusted name in the investing world  One of the pioneers of PMS business with over 14 years of PMS track record  Trusted by over 32,826 HNI investors and with over Rs. 15,658 Crs of AUM as on 31st December 2017.  Presence across the length and breadth of India and also overseas Basic Traits of our Investing Style  We invest in companies with operating leverage than financial leverage  We do not believe in “timing the market”, rather we believe in “spending time in market”  We do not over diversify  The businesses we invest, must have growth potential with economic moat  We practise long-term Buy and Hold investing style Investment Philosophy BUY RIGHT : SIT TIGHT Sit Tight Buy Right QGLP  ‘Q’uality denotes quality of the business and management  ‘G’rowth denotes growth earnings and sustained RoE  ‘L’ongevity denotes longevity of the competitive advantage or economic moat of the business   Buy and Hold: We are strictly buy and hold investors and believe that picking the right business needs skill and holding onto these businesses to enable our investors to benefit from the entire growth cycle needs even more skill.  Focus: Our portfolios are high conviction portfolios with 20 to 25 stocks being our ideal number. We believe in adequate diversification but over-diversification results in diluting returns for our investors and adding market risk in ‘P’rice denotes our approach of buying a good business for a fair price rather than buying a fair business for a good price Investment Philosophy Why BUY RIGHT : SIT TIGHT is significant ?  Real wealth is created by riding out bulk of the growth curve of quality companies and not by trading in and out in response to buy, sell and hold recommendations.  This philosophy enables investor and manager alike to keep focus on the businesses they are holding rather than get distracted by movements in share prices.  An approach of buying high quality stocks and holding them for a long term wealth creation motive, results in drastic reduction of costs for the end investor.  While BUY RIGHT is largely the role of the portfolio manager, SIT TIGHT calls for involvement from the portfolio manager as well as investor. This brings in greater accountability from the manager and at the same time calls for better involvement and understanding from investor resulting in better education for the latter.  Long term multiplication of wealth is obtained only by holding on to the winners and deserting the losers. Investment Philosophy QGLP – The investment philosophy has been framed out of 20 years of annual wealth creation studies authored by our co–founder, Raamdeo Agrawal. Q-G-L-P Demystified Enduring business, preferably consumer facing Compelling business opportunity Sustainable competitive advantage Competent management Reasonable valuation, relative to growth prospects High margin of safety Typically prefer stocks with earnings growth of around 1x Volume growth Price growth Operating leverage Financial leverage Long-term relevance of business Extended competitive advantage Initiatives to sustain growth for 10-15 years Investment Philosophy What is the relevance of Buy & Hold and Focused Portfolio? Buy & Hold leads to low churn ratio of the portfolio. If the portfolio is churned many times during a year, the fund will incur higher transaction costs, thus impacting the returns. On the other hand, low churn in the portfolio also indicates higher investment conviction of the Portfolio Manager thus indicating BUY RIGHT : SIT TIGHT Focused Portfolios: While it is true that diversification of portfolio leads to lesser risk, it is also a fact that overdiversification beyond a threshold, does not add any significant value. Both, in terms of wealth creation as well as minimizing the risk. Why Value Strategy? Because you deserve the best of the Large cap world ! Over 3500 listed companies in India. Large portion of this is junk stocks which do not have any underlying business fundamentals MOAMC applies QGLP filters and our universe narrows down to 300 odd stocks. High quality, high potential and highly regarded stocks. Out of these universe, we further filter down to large caps.

0,hdfcsec-research@hdfcsec.com,Resend - Media and Telecom: 3QFY18E Results Preview,"Dear Murthy, Media and Telecom: 3QFY18E Results Preview Media Zee Entertainment: Zee is well-poised for strong operating performance in the near term led by twin benefits of viewership gains and recovery in ad spends partly led by low base. Subscription revenue growth is expected to be modest led by digitisation. However increasing viewership on digital platforms and likely increase of competitive intensity in core regional markets poses risk to advertising revenues. Consolidation amongst DTH operators, lack of sports properties and weak balance sheet of MSOs can impact subscription revenue growth. Zees well-entrenched national footprint limits scope for expansion led growth. Zee has registered healthy growth in last 4-5 years as digitisation enabled launch of new channels and improved subscription revenues. However changing industry dynamics demanding increased investments on digital content and as the base-effect starts catching-up, delivering healthy double-digit growth could become challenging. We roll-forward to Dec-19 with TP of Rs 618 (Rs 575 earlier). Post 20% run-up in last three month from lows of Rs 480 and impending business risks, we downgrade Zee to Neutral from BUY. Dish TV Videocon: Dish would report its financials including Videocon D2H. We estimate financials of merged entity for 3QFY18 including historical for like-to-like comparison. We highlight that actual may vary materially in event of any changes to accounting policies of the two companies. Our positive view on Dish TV despite weak performance in recent past is derived from its inexpensive valuations (9.8/8.6x FY19/20E EV/E for merged operations without synergy) and synergies from the merger with VD2H (key focus area) and digitisation. Top pick: Dish TV Telecom 3QFY18 outlook: 3QFY18 is likely to be another weak quarter for Bharti and Idea. IUC rate cut by 57% (14p/min to 6p/min) effective 1 st Oct, 17 to impact Bharti and Ideas India wireless EBITDA leading to drop of 10% and 22% QoQ respectively. Accelerated ARPU downgrade (ex-IUC) on account of increasing proportion of bundled plans to further exert pressure. However, with sectors transformation into three player market, our medium term outlook is positive.

Subscription revenue growth is expected to be modest led by digitisation. However increasing viewership on digital platforms and likely increase of competitive intensity in core regional markets poses risk to advertising revenues. Consolidation amongst DTH operators, lack of sports properties and weak balance sheet of MSOs can impact subscription revenue growth. Zees well-entrenched national footprint limits scope for expansion led growth. Zee has registered healthy growth in last 4-5 years as digitisation enabled launch of new channels and improved subscription revenues. However changing industry dynamics demanding increased investments on digital content and as the base-effect starts catching-up, delivering healthy double-digit growth could become challenging. We roll-forward to Dec-19 with TP of Rs 618 (Rs 575 earlier). Post 20% run-up in last three month from lows of Rs 480 and impending business risks, we downgrade Zee to Neutral from BUY. Dish TV Videocon: Dish would report its financials including Videocon D2H. We estimate financials of merged entity for 3QFY18 including historical for like-to-like comparison. We highlight that actual may vary materially in event of any changes to accounting policies of the two companies. Our positive view on Dish TV despite weak performance in recent past is derived from its inexpensive valuations (9.8/8.6x FY19/20E EV/E for merged operations without synergy) and synergies from the merger with VD2H (key focus area) and digitisation. Top pick: Dish TV Telecom 3QFY18 outlook: 3QFY18 is likely to be another weak quarter for Bharti and Idea. IUC rate cut by 57% (14p/min to 6p/min) effective 1st Oct, 17 to impact Bharti and Ideas India wireless EBITDA leading to drop of 10% and 22% QoQ respectively. Accelerated ARPU downgrade (ex-IUC) on account of increasing proportion of bundled plans to further exert pressure. However, with sectors transformation into three player market, our medium term outlook is positive.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

Hurry, this exclusive offer is valid only until 11:59 pm tonight! Click here to sign up now. Most of us wait for some kind of reward, recognition, appreciation or acknowledgement from our bosses. And what better way than receiving a monetary acknowledgement. But what do you do when you receive such a high sum? How do you deploy it? Bhavik, a Senior Consultant working in a MNC received a hefty bonus of Rs 3 lakh. And he plans to buy 3 major things: A new music system - approx. cost Rs 30,000 A holiday to Norway to observe Northern Lights (approximate cost Rs 2,50,000) And save the balance money What do you think about Bhaviks plan? Well, in our opinion annual bonus is a form of windfall income . All of us desire to be blessed by a windfall income someday in the form of lottery, receiving inheritance, and so on. Most of desire to use this money in a way that we can go on a shopping spree or visit our favourite holiday destinations. But, let us apprise you, you can become even richer if this windfall income is used smartly . You see, allowing your money to work for you can enable you to live life more comfortably. So here are some of the smart ways to deploy your annual bonus money: Invest Sensibly As you would be aware, inflation erodes your income every single day. Thus, it is imperative that you invest your new-found wealth in order to meet your crucial financial goals. But be careful of where you are investing and refrain from getting caught in a hype, exuberance or what your friends and family have to say. You must always invest based on yourrisk appetite and asset allocation . To understand in detail watch this video on Assessing your Risk Appetite. Mutual funds are a good way to invest in equities for those who don't have knowledge about investing in stocks. Opt for a STP Another smart way is to start a Systematic Transfer Plan (STP). Under STP, a lump sum amount invested in a fund earlier can be transferred at regular intervals systematically in a piecemeal manner into another mutual scheme (as desired by you) of the same mutual fund house. Like Bhavik if you receive such hefty bonus, initially invest it in an ultra-short term debt fund and/or a liquid fund. Then, systematically a certain sum of money can be transferred monthly or quarterly to an equity-oriented fund of your choice over a period of time. Pay-off some/ all the debt Reducing your debtshould be amongst your top priorities when you plan to utilise the bonus. Any financial obligations such ascredit card dues, personal loans , business loans etc. should be repaid especially the ones that bear very high interest rates. By doing this you will not only save on a lot of interest payments but also improve your credit score. A healthy credit score is imperative in case you need to obtain further loans in the future. Boost Emergency Funds While being optimistic is a good thing, you should be aware that nothing in this world is permanent or guaranteed. It isimportant to have a contingency or emergency fund. And if you still have not created a separate fund for contingency then, you certainly need to create one with the help of the bonus amount received. Contingency Fund should take care of at least 6 to 12 months of your regular monthly expenses (including all the EMIs). Therefore, create this by deploying money in a separate saving bank account and/or liquid fund(s). Don't Ignore Taxes Taxes are an important aspect while managing windfall income. It is important to determine how and when the tax liability will arise. But you must not ignore your constitutional duty of paying tax. Of course, you can use the provisions of the tax laws to save taxes by planning your transactions well. Always ensure that you discharge this legal responsibility rightly and consider it as a moral responsibility too. Invest on Yourself With so much happening in life, many a times we tend to forget our own self-development. Utilise this bonus money to learn a new skill. Something which could be relevant to your job or an area of personal interest, such as photoshop, advance use of excel, cooking, baking, photography, music, etc. Basically, anything youve been putting off for the longest time. Learn new things that you are passionate about and upgrade yourself. This will boost your confidence. Eventually, this will help you grow in your professional or personal life. And if you wish to learn the art offinancial planning then, PersonalFN has developed a comprehensive program: Become Your Own Financial Planner. With this e-course, you too, can create a financial plan like an expert. It will be your guide to most serious decisions regarding money matters. The tutorials start with the basics of budgeting and managing cash flows and then moves on to how to set SMART goals. You will also learn how to select winning mutual funds, along with the right asset allocation and its importance. The modules will also outline strategies to build your optimum investment portfolio and much more. Apart from the video tutorials, you will get access to a host of downloadable calculators, such as a Cash Flow Calculator, Retirement Calculator, etc. Absolutely Free! Don't miss this opportunity. Subscribe to the e-course now! Dont do anything Yes, you read it right. If you are still not sure about how you can use this money, then do not touch this fund for some time at least. Most people can get overwhelmed by a windfall of money. Similarly, you too might be tempted to spend this fortune recklessly on expensive trips, luxury cars or extravagant things. Gaining a windfall might also lead you to impulsively lend money to your friends and relatives who are in need of financial help, but later might be incapable of repaying your loan. Or worse, you might land up investing in some dubious investment strategy which might never earn you any returns. Hence, set a cool down period of say 1 year. This ensures that you take time to think about how to use it and avoid the initial risk of spending or investing it out of excitement. So initially, the money can be held in liquid funds, money market instruments or savings account or in a one-yearFixed Deposituntil the decision to use it wisely is taken.These short-term instruments will provide capital protection and liquidity, albeit you would derive low real and tax-adjusted returns. To Conclude: Like Bhavik, avoid spending recklessly. Instead use this bonus money to build your wealth and create more money. It is vital to be prudent while spending this windfall income as you would not even realise when a huge portion of the inherited wealth is blown away without really improving your finances. PersonalFN is of the view that it is important that you sensibly account for the inherited wealth in your financial plan so as to meet your financial goals and live life comfortably. Remember that, using the services of an expert orexperienced financial planner for managing your finances will not be a waste of money.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant. Level /Title Non-CPA Salary CPA Salary Salary Differential Year 1 $68,000 $68,000 0 Year 2 (1-3 Year Associate) $82,000 $90,200 $8,200 Year 4 (Senior Auditor) $101,250 $111,375 $10,125 Year 11 (Manager) $124,525 $133,500 $8,975 Year 20 (Senior Manager) $162,477 $191,750 $29,723 Year 40 $293,451 $346,322 $52,871 Lifetime Earnings (Pre-tax) $6,934,600 $7,959,470 $52,871 CPA Incremental Lifetime Earnings $1,024,870 Source:Internet Scholarships available up to INR 33,000 for CAs enrolling for CPA Certification before 31st January 2018 .

If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation.

I am a CPA Advisor for CAs at Becker-EduPristine.I would like to let you know of the various opportunities CAs can unlock this year. If you are already a CA or have appeared for your CA Finals, then CPA is the next big thing you should look forward to. Here are 3 Reasons why the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Global Certification should be your goal for 2018. Become a CPA in less than 1 year : You can pass the CPA in a roadmap of less than 12 months as you only have to appear for the single-level exam with only 4 exam parts to acquire the certification. Global recognition: If you want to increase your territory and area of jurisdiction, which means if you wish to work beyond Indian boundaries other than India- like the USA or the middle-east then you should definitely go for CPA. Apart from this, you can work for MNCs since you will have all the required knowledge of the international standards- like IFRS, GAAS, and GAAP. Increased Demand for CPAs in India: CPA is the US Equivalent of CA. You also have an option of working as a controller or a CFO. You can expect a salary raise of 10-15%. Check Payscale . Global Indian companies publicly listed in the US (e.g. Wipro) require US CPAs for quarterly and annual financials, Sarbanes Oxley and other compliance reporting and documentation. All CPA is required to do highly specialized job functions, which is why they enjoy tremendous demand and high job security in the market. According to Robert Half's 2016 Salary Guide for Accounting & Finance, over the course of a 40-year career, a CPA may earn $1 Million more than Non-Certified Accountant.

 CMP: INR 373, TP: INR 537 upside 44%)","MOSt Discovery KEI Industries Limited - Initiating Coverage (Buy, CMP: INR 373, TP: INR 537, Upside 44%) Click here to access detailed report KEI Industries Ltd. (KEI) is ranked amongst the top 3 power cable companies in India and is also engaged in the EPC business. It manufactures high and low tension cables (HT, LT, EHV), control & instrumentation cables, house wires (HW), power cables, stainless steel wires (SSW) and electrical cables. The institutional segment is the largest revenue generator for the company (56% in FY17), followed by retail segment (30%) and exports segment (14%). KEI has been focusing on expanding its cable capacity to address growth prospects in various segments. It has been concentrating on improving its B2C (Retail Segment) share and growing institutional segment. KEI is looking at entering newer markets in South and East India, apart from existing North and West. The institutional segment along with EPC services has immense growth potential given the government emphasis on power and infra. Expanding retail segment to be a key growth driver: We expect retail segment revenue CAGR of 25% over FY17-20E to INR 16bn. Contribution from the segment is expected to go up from 30% in FY17 to ~36% by FY20 (management guidance is 40%). We expect HW revenue CAGR of 20% over FY17-20E to INR 7.4bn. KEI plans to increase its dealer network by 10-15% every year (from 1,274 dealers in 2QFY18 to 1,500 by end of FY18). EHV cables and EPC to drive institutional segment growth: KEI aims to strengthen its high-margin EHV segment (15% margins), with the installation of 400kV production line in FY17 (Segments revenue generating capacity increased to INR4bn). We expect EHV cables revenue to grow at a CAGR of 53% over FY17-20E to INR ~3.6bn. Its EPC order book has grown significantly from INR ~4bn in FY14 to INR ~20bn in FY17. We expect EPC revenue CAGR of 28% over FY17-20E, due to management's focus on order execution. Robust revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth with improving return ratios: Over FY12-17, KEI's Revenue/ EBITDA/ PAT grew at a CAGR of 9.2%/ 12.8%/ 32.3% to INR 26.7bn/ 2.7bn/ 0.9bn, respectively, with EBITDA margin expansion of ~155bps to 10.3%. We expect margins to improve further by ~75bps to 11% over FY17-20E on the back of increasing contribution from Retail & EHV segment and better execution in the EPC business. Going ahead, we expect Revenue/ EBITDA/ PAT CAGR of 18.7%/ 21.6%/ 33% to INR 44.6bn/ 4.9bn/ 2.3bn, respectively, over FY17-20E. RoE/ ROCE are expected to improve to 26.5%/ 20.5% by FY20 from 23.5%/ 18.5% in FY17. Valuation: KEI is likely to be a major beneficiary of key government initiatives in power, infrastructure and real estate sector. It has high return ratios, free cash flows and low debt to equity (0.7x FY20). Currently, KEI trades at 12.5x FY20 EPS. Given the high growth expectation along with healthy financials, we believe that the stock deserves higher valuations. We value KEI at 18x FY20EPS to arrive at a fair value of INR 537/share (44% upside) and initiate coverage with a BUY recommendation.
